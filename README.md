# Football--Tactical-Technical-Player-Evaluation

This football analysis system processes match videos to evaluate player performance using computer vision. It detects players and tracks movements with YOLOv8 and pose estimation, then analyzes technical skills (shooting, dribbling) and tactical decisions (passing, positioning). The system generates 3D visualizations of key moments and provides actionable feedback like "12Â° excessive body lean during shots." Coaches receive automated reports with heatmaps, biomechanical insights, and improvement suggestions. Built with PyTorch, MediaPipe, and OpenCV, it transforms video footage into data-driven performance metrics, helping optimize training and strategy. The tool automates what traditionally required hours of manual video analysis.
